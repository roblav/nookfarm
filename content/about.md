<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Nook Farm Honeyâ„¢ is a small-scale producer of local Cumbrian wildflower honey and also sells speciality honeys. Helen Griggs, her husband Duncan, and their daughter Kate, keep their bees at Nook Farm and at other locations in the Bailey and Kielder Forest area of North Cumbria. Nook Farm is idyllic, surrounded by wildflowers and unspoilt countryside. Traditional farming methods encourage the growth of Clover, Dandelion, Meadowsweet, Thistles, Willowherb and many other native species essential to honey bees. We have long Winters and short Summers, Spring starts with Hawthorn blossom and the end of the season comes with the flowering of Heather in the forests and on the fells.</p>
