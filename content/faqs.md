    <strong>Is your honey always available?</strong>
    <br>Honey is a seasonal product and this may mean that some of our honeys are not always available. Please contact us either by email or telephone to check if we are in stock. <br><br>

<li>
    <strong>How should your honey be stored?</strong>
    <br>Honey should be stored at room temperature ideally between 18-22ÂºC. Lower temperatures will cause honey to crystallise or granulate, if this occurs you may wish to place the jar in a bowl of warm water and the honey should become runny again. <br><br>
