<h1>Yorkshire Heather Honey</h1>
<p>
Our Heather honey is a smooth, rich flavoured and full bodied honey with a distinctive aroma. The initial taste is slightly caramel, and it is soon followed by a cooling sensation in the back of the mouth, it has complex aftertastes with a hint of aniseed. Heather honey needs very careful harvesting and delicate handling before it is bottled to retain all its unique natural properties. This wonderful honey is from Markâ€™s bees in North Yorkshire, he produces honey in batches specifically for us. Spread this honey onto buttered wholemeal toast or crusty bread, drizzle into porridge for the ultimate comfort food.</p>

Ling Heather grows in upland areas across the UK. It is a low flowering bushy shrub which has spectacular purple flowers often creating a carpet of colour when plants grow close together. During August hives are moved from the lowlands to the heather moors to be placed amongst the heather and if the weather is good the bees quickly produce Heather honey.</p>
