English Blossom Honey is a runny honey with a clear dark golden colour it has a strong sweet taste which melts away on your tongue. The flavours come from a mix of flowers such as Lime and Apple trees, Dandelion and Hawthorn this honey is carefully and lovingly harvested from Mahmoud's bees.</p>
<p>
This lovely honey is produced by Mahmoud whose apiaries are located in areas around parks, gardens and golf courses in Manchester where there is an abundance and variation of forage for the bees to gather. This gives the honey a luxurious texture and makes it a very versatile honey which can be used as a substitute for sugar in cooking and hot drinks. It adds flavour and sweetness without overpowering other tastes, great to use every day.</p>
