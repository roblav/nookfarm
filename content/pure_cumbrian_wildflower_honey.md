<h1>Pure Cumbrian Wildflower Honey</h1>
<p>
Our Wildflower Honey is very runny, it is beautiful in flavour and to look at, it is truly the taste of Cumbria. This Wildflower honey has a range of flavours from the wildflowers that grow in the countryside around Nook Farm. Our Wildflower honey can vary slightly from year to year. Willow Herb, Blackberry, Clover, Thistles, Meadowsweet, and Heather all play their part in the complexity of tastes in this exclusive honey.</p>
<p>
It is a luxury product and we often compare it to a fine wine or champagne in its quality and pedigree. We harvest our honey in late summer and it is always a time of great excitement and anticipation. Producing honey in our part of Cumbria is not easy but worth it, supply is limited and demand extremely high. We hope you enjoy this honey as much as we do.</p>
