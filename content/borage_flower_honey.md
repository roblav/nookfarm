<h1>Borage Flower Honey</h1>
<p>
Borage Honey is a single flower honey and unique in its flavour and quality. It is a pale light runny honey with a delicate mild taste. We work closely with Mark who keeps bees in Yorkshire and supplies us with Borage Honey. Borage honey is a very versatile honey and can be used to sweeten tea or coffee. It adds flavour and sweetness without overpowering other tastes. Borage Honey can be used instead of sugar and is probably better for you.</p>

In the summer a field of Borage will be alive with the sound of Honeybees. Borage or Starflower is a traditional medicinal and culinary herb native to the Mediterranean it was first cultivated in Turkey and Syria. You may be familiar with Borage in your garden or have seen the flowers in a glass of Pimmâ€™s.</p>
